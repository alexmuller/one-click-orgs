# HTML Mockups of the One Click Orgs UI #

This document is to describe some of the HTML mockups that have been created for the OCO UI. These HTML files have been tested in Firefox 3 and Safari 5 on OS X.

## General changes ##

* Brand the page in terms of the organisation being set up, with a subtle link to OCO. Org logo?
* Make clear that 'Settings' in the navigation is to do with the org and not the user?

## My Dashboard (`index.html`) ##

* The title of the page could be editable while the organisation is being set up. This works best in browsers that support the `placeholder` attribute (Firefox 4, WebKit: Chrome/Safari). Try typing and press enter.
* Show proposals still to vote on at the top of the list?

## Organisation Settings (`settings.html`) ##

* Still not happy with the way proposing an amendment works

## Constitution (`constitution.html`) ##

## Members (`members.html`) ##
